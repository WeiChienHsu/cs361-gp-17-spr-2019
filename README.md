## Vision Statement 10 %

- You will submit a draft of your vision statement for voting. Later in the quarter you will submit final version of the vision statement.

### Your draft vision statement consists of:

- A description of a problem. Examples: poverty, hunger, addiction, etc.

- A few paragraphs about an idea for a solution. Examples: a web application, mobile application, etc.

- Your final vision statement will follow the requirements provided in Canvas.

- Post the vision statement in Canvas as directed.

- Every student votes for interesting visions. (based on the drafts)

- The vision statements obtaining the most votes will be used to form groups.

- The authors of the vision statements assigned to each group are the customers for each project. They must approve every aspect of the design and provide feedback to implement their vision in an application. They will receive extra credit for directing the group.xw


## Project 40%

The project will be done in teams. 

- The project is to work on one of the classmate's envisioned solutions (proposed in the vision statement).

- The instructor assigns students to teams and assigns projects to teams.

- Every student must make contribution every week. When your team submits each homework, you must also indicate what each team member contributed. Individual team members will usually get approximately the same grade, but individual team member grades may be reduced depending on the quality and quantity of the contribution.

- For the second part of the project you will write code and real tests and submit the code. The idea is that, with the approval of the customer, each pair would select some feature and implement that and then write a test to check that particular implementation. 

- You will also have to perform integration testing/overall feature integration. 

- Grading will NOT be based on how many features/ functionality you have implemented, but whatever the number of features you have implemented, did you write test case(s) for them and are those actually well thought-out tests (because its possible to write a huge number of trivial tests that actually don't add any value).

- Whatever the number of features you decide to implement must work correctly and has to be substantial enough (decided by the grader) according to the number of
people in the group.
