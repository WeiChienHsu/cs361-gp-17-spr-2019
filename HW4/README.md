# HW 4 (team): 

In this homework, you will design an implementation of your system. You will start with **the architecture that you selected in HW3**, plus the **paper prototypes and requirements that you created in HW2**:

- [ ]  Draw a **UML class diagram** showing the **key OO entities** (and their attributes) in your system (approx 1 page); if the system is too large to fit all the UML classes on 1-2 pages, then just focus on one particularly important part of the system.

---

- [ ]  Explain how you would **package the implementations of these entities**; in particular, assess your packaging scheme in terms of coupling and cohesion (approx 1 page)

- [ ]  Assess how well your design would support **incremental or iterative development**, based on the requirements and the potential for code reuse (approx 0.5 page)

---

- [ ]  Explain which **design patterns** would be useful for implementing the system, and why (approx 1 page)

- [ ] Select **a use case** from HW2 and **draw a sequence diagram** showing how that use case would play out in the system; this sequence diagram should **differ from the sequence diagrams in earlier homeworks**, in that the sequence for the current assignment should show **how specific classes participate in supporting the use case** (approx 1 page)

---

- [ ] Identify several **interfaces** that would be needed and specify a contract for each (approx 1 page)

- [ ] Identify several **exceptions** that are likely to occur and what the exception handlers would do (approx 0.5 page)

---

- [ ] Briefly summarize the contribution of each of your team members.

- Deadline: `May 12 at 11:59pm`
