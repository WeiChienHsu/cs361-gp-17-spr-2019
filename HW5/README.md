# HW 5 (team): 

- Meet with the customer to develop 10-20 user stories 
- As a team, break the user stories into tasks. 
- Decide which tasks will be easier or harder to implement, and estimate effort 

- Meet with the customer to prioritize user stories into three groups: the stories that you will implement this week, the stories that you will implement next week, and the stories that you will probably not have time to implement at all. 

- Note to the customer: be reasonable. 

- If the team says that you're asking too much, then you're probably asking too much! 
- Plan how your team will tackle the tasks for homework 6 and 7 
- Perform a spike for any user stories that seem especially risky

- Deadline: `May 26 at 11:59pm`

***

## Task

- Describe your 10-20 user stories (approx 2 pages) 

- For each user story, indicate when the story is due (if at all) and list the corresponding tasks. For each task, indicate if you think that it logically should be completed before or after another task. In addition, how long you think that it would take a pair of programmers, working together, to complete the task. (approx 2 pages) 

- For each user story due next week, either give a UML sequence diagram showing what your implementation will look like, or describe a spike that you did in order to learn about how to implement the user story (approx 3 pages) 

- Outline your plan for implementing the stories due next week -- who is doing what, when? (approx 1 page) 

- In one sentence, briefly summarize whether your customer was willing and able to meet with you. Also, indicate if you think that the customer was reasonable about what will be due on Tuesday. 

- If your customer cannot meet with you on those days, then assign one of your teammates to play the role of the customer. 

- Briefly summarize the contribution of each of your team members.
